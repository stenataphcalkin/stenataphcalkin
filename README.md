## Hello there, I'm Stenataphcalkin*! 👋

I'm a full stack developer in-training, currently leveling up my skills at Tech Educators, where I'm undertaking a 12-week intensive course to master the art of building web applications from front to back.

My coding journey started in 2008, programming text adventure games in Inform 7, HTML & CSS with a Wiki for a roleplaying game I run, and 10 years of working the digital marketing landscape.

***Now it's time to put on the programming*** ~~socks~~ ***hat and dive straight into the deep-end.***

## When I'm not coding, you can find me:

<ul>
<li>🕹 Catching 'em all: I'm a HUGE Pokémon fan. I've previously competed in the Pokémon Trading Card Game Internationals. 🃏</li>

<li>🎲 Rolling for initiative: As a Dungeon Master and player, I love getting lost in fictional, fantastical worlds. 🐉</li>

<li>🍣 Fueling up: I love to cook! It's another way I get to be creative and share something with the people I care about. 🥰</li>

<li>🤓 Embracing my inner geek: Whether diving into a board game or card game, or crafting a new cosplay prop 👑</li>

</ul>
I'm excited to share my projects as I grow and learn. Thanks for stopping by!
